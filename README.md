# ethio-alert-rescue

Develop a fully responsive web application named "Ethio Alert" specifically tailored for Ethiopian users. The webapp should incorporate GPS functionality to facilitate the dispatch of emergency workers (ambulances, fire fighters, and police) to users in need of immediate assistance. The landing page should feature animated buttons, a captivating logo, and a sign-up/log-in page for both workers and users. The home page should utilize a social media template to display user information, including profile pictures, and generate a dynamic list of three nearby emergencies and available emergency stations. Additionally, the worker page should include a switch enabling workers to switch between online and offline modes. Furthermore, the worker page should generate a list of three successfully resolved emergencies, providing detailed information about each case.
